# Time Table Gen

## Description
This java app generates timetables for websites. We use it as https://scbirs.ch/ to
visualize when each of our teams has training. It's ideal to print and hang on your fridge.

## Compile & Run
You currently need at least Java 10 to run this app. It can probably technically be compiled with Java 8 but
this is not tested.
